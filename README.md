# find-number
Find the value in an array of ordered lists.
Premiseï¼šThe array has fixed length,if the ordered list's length is larger than the length of arr,
         the rest of numbers will sequentially override the array from the head.
For example: arr.length = 6   list = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9       
             so the array is [7,8,9,4,5,6]
